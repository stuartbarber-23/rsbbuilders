                    <h1>Recommendations</h1>
					<h2>Side Extension and Renovation to Existing Property</h2>
						<p>I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased we are not only with the standard of work; we felt was marvellous, but also with the professional, cleanliness and overall courteous manner in which it was carried out. To this end I would have no hesitation in recommending RSB Builders to anyone requiring major building work such as ours or indeed any other similar works.</p>
						<p>Mr Potbury</p> 
						<p>Slinfold, Sussex</p>
						<p>January 2010</p>
					<h2>Groundworks to New Residential Property</h2>
						<p>RSB Builders have been employed to carry out building works on two of my previous properties. The first was to rebuild a porch after an insurance claim due to damage and the second far larger project was for the setting out, groundwork’s, foundations , drainage and brick/  blockwork to DPC on a new build. </p> 
						<p>Mr Barber correctly read and reviewed all plans, drawings and specifications highlighted anomalies and willingly offered solutions. Would accurately calculate material quantities and advise in advance. There is never an ‘It will be alright’ or ‘we’ll sort it out on the day’ attitude. He is also very professional with all other trades; how they will all interface and accommodates for their needs. </p>
						<p>RSB Builders are a thoroughly trustworthy company, experienced and knowledgeable. I would have no hesitation in recommending them. Indeed I look forward to another project together. </p>

					<h2>Side Extension and Renovation of Existing Property</h2>
						<p>RSB builders have been working in this area for over 20 years. During that time they have completed work for us on two occasions in a very professional manner.</p> 
						<p>We moved locally in September 2009 into a small bungalow ideally situated near the village centre but which needed extending to meet our needs. RSB Builders were our first choice for this project. We were pleased to get there input through Richard from an early stage. Early consultation at the planning stage ensured all practical aspects of the construction were considered before work commenced. </p> 
						<p>We were given a time slot when they would become available and expected build time. Both were honoured fully. A detailed cost estimate with any possible extra expenditure was given and agreed, such as no unexpected costs were incurred. </p>
						<p>Every aspect of the build was discussed in good time before each stage of the job commenced. Due to the level of forward planning no major changes were needed. All additional trades, e.g. Electricians were scheduled at the appropriate time with good cooperation all round. Good guidance on suppliers was given where there was a choice, e.g. Kitchen Units. </p>  
						<p>My wife and I are delighted with the completed extension which was completed in time and on budget to a very satisfactory standard. </p>  
						<p>I can recommend RSB Builders to anyone needing a good, reliable, conscientious builder. </p> 
						<p>Mr Bishop</p>
						<p>Bosham, Surrey</p>
						<p>November 2010</p>
					<h2>Kitchen replacement with new ceiling, and lounge wall repairs</h2>
						<p>Word of mouth recommendation is worth a lot when tackling a project such as ours but as well as having dealt with RSB some 20 years ago on a re-roofing job we were delighted to find that the company was again in our neighbourhood, working on a friend's home extension. </p>
						<p>After seeing the work done for them we were convinced that our own relatively minor job would be in sound hands in renewing the acquaintance. As well as fitting a tailor-made kitchen, a false ceiling and secret wiring were also required. The adjoining lounge needed plaster removal and blockwork renewal. </p>
						<p>RSB kept us informed on the start date, helped enormously in choosing the position of units and electrical equipment  and were a mine of information on sourcing of ideas and materials. The actual work was carried out in such an efficient  and friendly way that we felt a personal loss when the work came to an end and the company left. The work carried out was of a meticulous standard; nothing was too much trouble  and some suggestions on best use of the kitchen space was brilliant. </p>
						<p>With absolutely no hesitation we recommend RSB to anyone seeking a quality building company that put the customer first and foremost. </p>
					<h2>Recommendation published onto Which? Local</h2>
						<p>Attention to detail, quality of workmanship, many good references from neighbours and an earlier job very well made us turn to this builder for the fitment of our new kitchen. Richard's advice and helpful manner was invaluable and his patience and amiability made this domestic upheaval entirely painless. </p>

					<h2>Rear extension and raised patio area (with disabled facility)</h2>
						<p>All aspects of RSB Builders workmanship has been first class, in fact incomparable. Every stage of the build of our extension to our home has been logically planned ensuring the minimum of disturbance to us and has been aesthetically pleasing from the outset. </p> 
						<p>Help and information when required (often in our case) were positive and thoughtful. The whole team have made the experience a pleasure and daily improved our lives so considerably that it is with regret that we are reaching the stage of completion. </p>
						<p>Looking forward to our next project. </p>

					<h2>Two Three-Storey, Four Bedroom Detached Houses</h2>
						<p>Firstly, we would like to thank you for the enormous amount of planning and effort that you put into every aspect of building our two new 4 bedroom detached houses and garaging. In particular, the way in which you actively contributed to help us complete this project on time and slightly under budget.  The end result is two beautiful homes that are a testament to your attention to detail and incredible tenacity.</p>
						<p>Our Chambre builder de l'année 2014!!!!</p>
						<p>Thank you RSB builders.</p>

						<p>Storrington, Sussex</p>
						<p>February 2014</p>
					<h2>Side and Rear Extension</h2>
						<p>Richard Barber, of RSB Builders, has worked on our house on two separate occasions.</p>
						<p>The first project was our first floor side extension to create an additional bedroom in late 2012. We were impressed with Richard's work; he dedicated himself wholly to our project and works were completed on time and on budget.  Materials were ordered in a timely manner and the site was always kept spotlessly tidy. </p> 
						<p>So when we decided to build our single storey rear extension we did not hesitate in contacting Richard again. Work began in March of this year (2014) and finished in June.  Once again works commenced well and the site was kept very tidy.  On this project a number of decisions had to be made as works commenced but this was always done in a timely manner with Richard offering his expertise where required. </p>  
						<p>We are very happy with the final result on both of our extensions and would not hesitate to recommend RSB Builders in the future.</p>

					<h2>2 Storey Extension including Horsham Stone Roof</h2>
						<p>Now that the project is completely finished, Kate and I wanted to extend our heartfelt thanks for your professional approach to our extension which was delivered on time and on most importantly, on budget! We are so pleased with the new rooms and Lucy says "thanks for her new bedroom!" The annexe area has been well used by my mum and some of Kate's family already and competition is brewing to decide which lucky relative will staying with us at Christmas!</p>
						<p>Thanks once again and we shall be recommending your services to anyone we can.</p>

					<h2>Three Bedroom Detached Timber Framed New Build</h2>
						<p>For many years Richard Barber has undertaken the odd jobs that arise from time to time with the houses and buildings around the farm.</p>
						<p>A wood framed house designed by Potton Ltd arose to be built on the farm in 2014. Richard acted as the project manager and undertook much of the work himself.</p> 
						<p>He was always a pleasure to deal with and his knowledge and skills proved invaluable with both the erection of the building and dealing with the various official bodies involved. His advice and work was always timely and completed to a high professional standard.</p>  
						<p>I have no hesitation in recommending him for similar jobs.</p>
						<p>Mr Bell</p>

					<h2>Contemporary Build & Major Renovation</h2>
						<p>After living with the design concept and plans for 18 months we embarked on
							a total house (circ 1903) renovation plus a large modern extension and
							Richard Barber of RSB Builders came to us highly recommended.</p>
						<p>All the way through the 10 month project we found Richard's enthusiasm,
							excellent cooperation and communication, plus his hard work ethic and
							professional attitude to be refreshing. Nothing was too much trouble, even
							when we introduced new materials and technologies to the mix, he took it all
							in his stride. His overall experience and wide ranging knowledge of the building industry
							and building products was extremely valuable to this build.</p>
						<p>Of particular value to us was his ability to both project manage the whole
							project, manage various other trades and do many elements of the build
							himself. We are delighted with the house and would have no hesitation in recommending the services of Richard Barber, RSB Builders</p>
